This guide will walk you through extracting audio files from .bank files using QuickBMS and FSB_Aud_Extr.
Step 1: Extract .bank Files Using QuickBMS (Manual Process)

Since QuickBMS requires user interaction, follow these manual steps:

    Open QuickBMS (quickbms.exe).

    Select the dump_fsbs script.

    Choose the .bank file you want to extract.

    Select the output folder where you want the extracted .fsb files to be saved.

    Wait for QuickBMS to finish the extraction.

Once this is complete, you should have one or more .fsb files in your chosen output folder.
Step 2: Extract Audio Files from .fsb Using FSB_Aud_Extr

After QuickBMS extracts the .fsb files, you can extract the actual audio using FSB_Aud_Extr.
Option 1: Run the Command Manually

Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) in the folder where fsb_aud_extr.exe is located and run the following command:

fsb_aud_extr.exe <input.fsb>
